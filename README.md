### Introduction
The goal of this project is to implement the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network using the CUDA programming model. 
The LeNet-5 architecture was introduced by Yann LeCun in 1998 and is widely used for handwritten digit recognition.
The goal of this work is to develop an effective neural network for digit recognition, optimized by leveraging GPU architecture to parallelize computational calculation.

Our project is a from scratch project based on the paper "Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition" [^1] and the article of Medium "LeNet-5 Complete Architecture" [^2].

The project is essentially divided into two phases: the first involves implementing a functional neural network, and the second focuses on optimizing and analyzing the code.
